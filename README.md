# PNW Ski Conditions Site

PNW Ski Conditions aims to simplify the decision process of where to go skiing by providing only the important information to the user, in a neat table for whatever mountains they choose. Get information like snow precip, non-snow precip, average temperatures, etc. across multiple time frames. And links to each of the ski area's NOAA and NWAC avalanche forecasts are provided for easy access.
